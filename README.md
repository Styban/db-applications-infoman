# Building a Python JSON Server with Flask and MariaDB

In this guide, we will create a Python JSON server using Flask and MariaDB. This server will serve JSON data related to persons and can search for persons by their first name.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) (for the database)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) (for the web server)

You can install the required modules using the following commands:

```bash
pip install mariadb
pip install flask
